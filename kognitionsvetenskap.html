<h2>What is Cognitive Science?</h2>

<p>An overall goal is to better understand the interaction between people and their environment,
in order to contribute to the development of systems, artifacts and methods that work well for people.
Cognitive Science explores the thinking from multiple scientific perspectives. The phenomena of perception,
behavior, memory, learning, communication, concept formation, decision making, and human interaction with and
in complex environments is central. These phenomena are studied by combinations of knowledge and methods from
psychology, computer science, neuroscience, biology, linguistics, philosophy, anthropology, education,
and informatics. The multifaceted approach based on: artificial systems such as robots and virtual agents;
biological systems, particularly, humans and other animals; how knowledge creatures evolve over time:
an evolutionary and individually, and how the structures of cognitive processes vary under different circumstances.</p>
<h2>What is interaction design?</h2> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/84K8RKz.jpg?1"/>
<p>Interaction means collaboration, interaction and mutual influence. In today's world of mobile phones and increasingly
advanced information and interaction technology arises a great need for good usability.
The area is focused on utility and usability. Where we talk about the digital products will fit into its context,
be easy to use and support people in their tasks. That view is based on the academic areas as human-computer
interaction and informatics, and there are often about digital tools for efficient work. Unlike traditional
graphic design and interface design (GUI design) comprise interaction design of a system's behavior and flows.
For example, how the various stages of your mobile phone's menus will be designed for you to quickly and easily
send an SMS, and how any error messages can support you.</p>
<h2>In short...</h2>
<p>The education Cognitive Science, with knowledge about how people think
and interact with the technology in diffrent context ased on having learned how people think and process information (sensory, processing through working/short/long-term memory, etc.).
Technologies such as from a stove, microwave, ATMs, websites, mobile phones, computer programs.
To design a information system is to design for how people use technology in the best possible way that humans think is logical and will then become easier to use, usability.
From adjusting man to technology, to adapt the technique to humans.
