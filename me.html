       <p> I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself.
       I´m dedicated to HCI - Human Computer Interaction and Cognitive Science. 
        I´ve always wanted to work with people and computer, so what is better than to be an cognitiv scientist? 
         I´m a specialist in Cognitive Science. Many people wonder if there is similar to the behavioral sciences,
         and it would be easiest to describe it as we study human from different angles. I´ve got knowledge of how
         humans think and operate, particularly to Information Technology but is very useful in several areas where
         the topic is so broad. The program studied various fields such as philosophy, psychology, neuroscience,
         computer science, linguistics and anthropology among others. This knowledge is very important if you would
         like to design IT-systems with usability experience in focus and make easy-to-use systems. It´s very often
         the company has one picture of its own system, how it works and process but the customer/user has another
         one from its own perception and representations model.</p> <p>
        This webbpage is growing along my studies in learning javascript.</p>
        
        <p>I did a movie that shows how much my family represents my personality.
         However, I haven´t much pictures of myself because it´s (almost) always me who is behind the camera.</p>
