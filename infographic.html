		<h2>CV Linda Seitzberg</h2>
		
		
	<p>	With education in interaction design, human-computer-interaction (HCI) and excellence in Cognitive Science,
	I´m specialized in design questions and UX (from idea to final product). Usability and quality are key words in my work.
	I´m educated to test, shape and evaluate the entire user experience of an idea, product or service, from concept to
	usability testing, prototyping to finished product. My goal is to create solutions to seemingly difficult problems.
	I'm passionate about cognitive science, usability, information technology, communication and marketing.</p>
	
	<p>In my studies I´ve done several projects towards companies. My bachelor thesis in Cognitive Science is focused on usability, design in software, learning processes
	in computer supported collaborative cooperation in a EU-project called Project 5T. Read more about it <a href="http://his.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A844080&dswid=-210">here</a>
	</p>	
<p>Cognitive Science studies various fields such as philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, computer science,
linguistics and anthropology among others. In my education I´ve worked with design, evaluate and develop
prototypes to present the user interface, worked with GUI-development and GOMS, heuristic evaluations and
prototype tools for graphical interfaces, wireframe, etc., and worked with concept development. I`ve also
study Information design with focus on text at Mälardalen University, which complements my training in information
technology. </p>
<p>Today I´m studying Javascript; Lernia on distance, that is really fun and gives endless possibilities
in creating content on web. </p>
